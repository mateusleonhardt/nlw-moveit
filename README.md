# Move.it

## Short description
It is an application that uses the technique of Pomodoro + Gamefication.
> The Pomodoro Technique is a method of time management. 

The idea for the application was presented at the 4th edition of Rocketseat's NLW (Next Level Week). Basically, the application is responsible for displaying a minute counter that, when it reaches the end, triggers a visual and audible notification for the user to perform an exercise. When the user finishes the exercise and confirms the execution of it, he will receive experience so that in this way he will level up in the "game".

## Running the application
1. Download or Clone the application on your machine;
2. Access the project folder in the Windows CMD (Command Prompt);
   Example: ``cd C: \\ nlw-moveit``
3. Install the project dependencies with the command ``yarn`` if you use Yarn, otherwise run the command ``npm i``;
4. After installing the dependencies, run the project with the command ``yarn dev`` or ``npm run dev`` and access the path http://localhost:3000;

> Access the project folder using your preferred code editor;
